                "Our first season of FTC was rough around the edges but ultimately a challenging and insightful experience for our team. As a rookie team we fell victim to numerous traps in our design and building process, leading us to waste time and resources on designs which ultimately failed or never came to be. In our first robot we went for the obvious method of scoring points: lifting blocks into the baskets, while we dismissed the pull up bar as an impossibility for our new team and only gave the flag turner a brief afterthought. The robot, when \u201Ccomplete,\u201D was little better than a prototype. The drive base was simple but effective, however everything piled haphazardly on top of it was laughably useless. Our block scoring mechanism was made of wood for lack of metal parts, our flag turner was a Mindstorms motor, and our robot was held together by its string suspension system. Our first competition, the FTC qualifier at Saratoga High School, we fell apart. Literally: the robot was in pieces, the competition had been Murphy\u2019s Law at it\u2019s finest.",
                "After the competition we were in shock, but after a few days we came to and set at work to rebuild a better robot. Over Thanksgiving break we sat in one of our team leads\u2019 living room and decided upon major points: points were our goal as opposed to blocks, we needed more parts to have any hope of being competitive, and that accepting that our first robot had failed was important in us moving on to the next robot. In the weeks following that meeting we crunched and were able to build our second robot, just barely in time for our second qualifier at Valley Christian High School. Our second robot was the antithesis of our first: where the first had been a blind attempt to score block points, our second was a sleek, barebones robot which aimed to score as many points as we could while still allowing us to build it in under a month. Our second robot virtually ignored the baskets and blocks, aiming to score as many peripheral points as possible (50 from hanging, 35 from the flag, 20 for being on the ramp at the end of autonomous, and finally 20\/40 from a blindly dumped autonomous block).",
                "The robot was an unprecedented success, although kinks in the design held us back in the standings, we obtained the highest block scores in each competition which we competed at. Sadly, we were too little, too late and were unable to qualify for the next level of FTC competition. What we did learn from the two robots was the importance in timing, a robot which could grab all of the \u201Cdifficult\u201D points during the first qualifier would be enough to qualify for the next round, but by building it for our second competition it wasn\u2019t enough to compete with the more complex \u201Cdo-it-all\u201D robots. Next year one of our biggest goals will be to build a robot which is designed to maximize points scored first, and only after we have that robot working will we either build a second robot or improve the first in order to address all elements of the game. Doing so should allow us to qualify for the next level of FTC, and lead to competitive season for our robots and team."

This function of the robot was something other robots did not have and while the robot was not as efficient at stacking totes, this specific aspect of the robot made it very useful to teams that needed the containers.",

Our new alliance partners were the Funky Monkeys (team 846) and Team Kika Mana (team 368) all the way from Hawaii!  We were thrilled to get picked, and we knew we had a good chance going into the matches.  Our alliance did an amazing job in the elimination matches, and we made it to the semi-finals. Unfortunately, we were unable to beat the top two-seeded alliances due to some technical issues, but we placed third overall!  It was so exciting for our team to place so well after a tough competition at the Sacramento Regional.  For a second year team we are extremely proud of what we have accomplished, and we are so excited to challenge ourselves in the years to come!"
