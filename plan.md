* DONE] JSON file on server containing blog text, headline, date, author, team/title
* [DONE] Parse the json for angular
* There should be a dedicated brief on what the blog entry is about that shows under the blog headline, date, author, and team/title
* OR just take the first sentence or so from the blog entry
* Click on the blog to expand the blog to fit the whole page
* Maybe change the big banner image on top, like medium does it
* Support for images and videos in the text
* No comments section. looks bad
* Blogs should have permalink
* Navigation bar at the top as header bar, drop down to the side of our content
* Once the team is solidified we can set up a description for each team member in blogs.json, with their name, team, grade
* Some backend stuff needed to be done for the contact form so that the message is properly sent. Dunno if angular has something for e-mails
* For some reason when you switch between the home tab on the navigation bar, the div moves ever so slightly, idk why. I'll look into it <-------- it's because of the scroll bar. so now we should incorporate it into our stylesheet, so that the page shifts to the right when the bar appears, since the bar pushes everything to the left.
