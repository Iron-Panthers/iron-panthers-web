* DONE] JSON file on server containing blog text, headline, date, author, team/title
* [DONE] Parse the json for angular
* There should be a dedicated brief on what the blog entry is about that shows under the blog headline, date, author, and team/title
* OR just take the first sentence or so from the blog entry
* Click on the blog to expand the blog to fit the whole page
* Maybe change the big banner image on top, like medium does it
* Support for images and videos in the text
* No comments section. looks bad
* Blogs should have permalink
* Navigation bar at the top as header bar, drop down to the side of our content
* Once the team is solidified we can set up a description for each team member in blogs.json, with their name, team, grade
* Some backend stuff needed to be done for the contact form so that the message is properly sent. Dunno if angular has something for e-mails
* For some reason when you switch between the home tab on the navigation bar, the div moves ever so slightly, idk why. I'll look into it
