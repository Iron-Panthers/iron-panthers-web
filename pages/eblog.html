		<p id="postPreview">Planning and preparation for Recycle Rush continues today as the Robotics Team meets for their late night Wednesday work sessions. In these five hours, the programmers and engineers have time to really delve into the nitty gritty details of the game and trouble shoot any problems they encounter. Moreover, the team is able to utilize the lab for an extended period of time with the help of mentors who arrive after they have finished work.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">Engineering is dedicating time to learning about different methods for picking up totes: the building blocks for the towers that the robot must build during competition. They began by hosting a round table discussion of various tote mechanisms, then transitioned into watching “Robot in 3 Days” videos in which teams build robots for the FRC challenge within 3 days. These videos gave the engineering team some jumpstarting points for developing their tote chute. Ideally, the chute will be used to hold totes that the human player places inside.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">While Engineering is hard at work, programmers are expanding on their plan for how to organize and manage code this season. Leads Leon and Peter led a tutorial on how they envision coding for Recycle Rush; most of the programming team attended so they will be prepared for the remainder of build season. In addition, programmers will begin to experiment with the different parts of the roboRio program, an extremely compact and powerful controlling system.</p>

		<p id="postPreview">The last few days of winter break were busy for the Iron Panthers. Following kickoff at Woodside High, the engineers and programmers shuttled off to the house of Engineering Lead, Reuben Grossman to read and discuss the rules. Reading each and every section of the game manual out loud, the team made sure to acquaint themselves with the specifics of the game so they could be prepared for competitions this season.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">Monday was another day off for BHS students, but not for the Iron Panthers! Engineers and programmers met to review the rules once more and start discussing  the merits of various strategies. They concurred that moving the totes would be the  key part of the robot’s functions. On the other hand, using a cost benefit analysis, they reached the conclusion that picking up the pool noodles “litter” would not be advantageous.</p>
		<p id="postPreview">Today is Tuesday, and the team is beginning to start developing a game plan for tackling Recycle Rush. Programmers are outlining how they are going to design and allocate the code, as well as coordinate which team members will work on specific systems. Engineers are making sure that all members have read the rules.</p>

		<p id="postPreview">As the FTC season winds down, the Iron Panthers gear up for the new FRC challenge starting January 3, 2015. As part of this new season, the engineering and programming teams will post periodic "e-log" updates about what they're doing to this page. Please check from time to time, because we will be updating frequently!</p>
